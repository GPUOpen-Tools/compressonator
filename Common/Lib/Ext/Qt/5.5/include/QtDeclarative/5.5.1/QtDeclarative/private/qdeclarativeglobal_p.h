    Returns true if the case of \a fileName is equivalent to the file case of

    This is used to ensure that the behavior of QML on a case-insensitive file
    system is the same as on a case-sensitive file system.  This function
    performs a "best effort" attempt to determine the real case of the file.
    It may have false positives (say the case is correct when it isn't), but it
    should never have a false negative (say the case is incorrect when it is
    correct).

    Length specifies specifies the number of characters to be checked from
    behind. That is, if a file name results from a relative path specification
    like "foo/bar.qml" and is made absolute, the original length (11) should
    be passed indicating that only the last part of the relative path should
    be checked.
