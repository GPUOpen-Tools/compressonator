V4.4
~~~~
July 2023

**Features**

- SIMD Support in BC1 Encoding

    - Added new code paths for SSE4, AVX2, and AVX-512 encoding in Compressonator Core that are automatically chosen based on CPU support
    - New functions added to the core interface to allow users to manually enable/disable SIMD instructions if desired: **EnableSSE4()**, **EnableAVX2()**, **EnableAVX512()**, and **DisableSIMD()**
    - Another new function was added to allow users to query the SIMD instruction set extensions currently being used in Compressonator Core: **GetEnabledSIMDExtension()**

- Mipmap Generation Updates
    
    - New option called "FilterGamma" added to Compressonator CLI which allows users to apply gamma correction to mipmap levels after generation
    - Mipmap generation behaviour has been modified to only stop once all dimensions of the mipmap level are equal to or below the minimum size specified

- Miscellaneous Changes

    - The default location of build artifacts has changed from *build* to *build/bin*, and build scripts have been moved to *build*
    - A new CMake project for building only the SDK in various configurations has been created under the *build/sdk* folder
    - The regular CMake build now requires three environment variables to be set that point to external dependency installations: **OPENCV_DIR**, **QT_DIR**, and **VULKAN_DIR** (more details can be found in the build section of the docs)
    - 16-bit PNG support added to Compressonator Framework
    - Removed implicit channel swizzling from all codec buffer classes, ensuring more consistent behaviour
    - Renamed CMP_TestCore project to CMP_UnitTests and expanded the suite of unit tests
    - Fixed compilation errors for BC6H core shader
    - Dependency on DirectX 9 and DirectX 10 DLL files has been replaced with the use of DirectXTex
    - Silent option in Compressonator CLI properly disables all output other than fatal errors.
    - Edited documentation to fix typo for "GenGPUMipMaps" option
    - Improved BC7 codec performance by keeping initialization data in memory rather than freeing it after each call to CMP_ConvertTexture

**Known issues and limitations**

- Compressing RG8 format images to BC5 results in black data in the output red channel
- Potential buffer overflow in RG8 Codec Buffer class when converting RG8 data to BC5
- Swizzling is not supported in all variations of the codec buffer classes

V4.3
~~~~
January 2023

**Features**

- Brotli-G

    - New lossless compression format CMP_FORMAT_BROTLIG that can compress all types of data, not just textures
    - Command line support via CompressonatorCLI as format "BRLG"
    - Encoding is done using the CPU and decoding can be done by either the CPU or GPU
    - New Compressonator file format for compressed Brotli-G data, ".brlg"

- Mipmap Updates

    - Generating mipmaps in the GUI app will process every selected image, rather than stop after the first one
    - Fixed crash when trying to generate mipmaps for a file with existing mipmaps
    - Fixed crash when attempting to generate mipmaps for greyscale images through the GUI app

- Compressed to Compressed Format Transcoding

    - Supports BCn to BCn conversions
    - Works by using a temporary uncompressed format as an intermediate: compressed input → uncompressed → compressed output

- RGBA1010102 Format Support

    - Added new format: CMP_FORMAT_RGBA_1010102 which is a variation of the existing CMP_FORMAT_2101010 format
    - Added ability to load DDS files in the new format

- Option to Use Original File Names when Compressing

    - Changed default behaviour of CompressonatorCLI so that it no longer "mangles" names, meaning it no longer adds extra text to the end of destination file names to identify the source file extension and destination format. 
    - When processing batches of files CompressonatorCLI will use the source file names as the destination, unless multiple sources share the same file name. In that case, it will mangle the file names of the repeated files.
    - Added the flag "-UseMangledFileNames" for CompressonatorCLI that will revert back to the previous behaviour of mangled destination file names.
    - A new application setting was added to CompressonatorGUI, "Use Original File Names", which will use the source's file name as the destination's file name for the first destination per source. This is enabled by default.

- BC6H Codec Improvements
   
   - Better handling of edge cases like infinity and NaN values in the input data
   - BC6H_SF preserves negative numbers through compression and decompression

- Mesh Optimization

   - Saved results can no longer contain invalid GLTF data when the input lacks some properties, like animations
   - Fixed handling of file paths so that paths with drive letters specified in them work as expected
   - Improved error messages and error handling

- GUI Compression Consistency Improvement

   - Changes made to the three main processing buttons: the button in the top bar, the button in the property view, and the right-click context menu. Their behaviour is now more consistent regardless of program state.

- Miscellaneous Changes/Improvements

    - CMP_FORMAT_RGBA_32F is recognized as a valid format for compression
    - Fixed BC4 compression with R8 input
    - Various small improvements in how CompressonatorCLI handles files and folders, especially in batch processing

**Known issues and limitations**

- Transcoding decreases image quality.
- R8 images are currently loaded into the red channel of a 4 channel ARGB_8888 image. This does not affect the results of any compressions, but the GUI will continue to show ARGB_8888 instead of R_8.
- The GPU_HW encoding option produces corrupted results on some machines when encoding to BC4_S or BC5_S. There is also an issue with generating and compressing mipmaps using the GPU_HW option that results in the lower mipmap levels being completely blank on some machines.
- Brotli-G encoding might sometimes result in compressed files that are slightly larger than the source file, particularly for well compressed sources. This is a limitation similar to ZIP compression, where small files or well compressed images might not be able to be compressed very well.
- Brotli-G encoding treats all source files as merely binary data, so it will not be able to create mipmaps or do any other extra processing to images during encoding.

V3.1
~~~~
November 2018

**Features**

-  **Fresh New Installers:** 

    When installing to Windows with V3.1 release, you will notice that there are several separate new installers: SDK, GUI and CLI, which when all used result in the following file structure under \\Program Files\\Compressonator 3.1

        |image126|

    The bin and license folders are created when the user installed GUI or CLI. When the SDK is installed,  an examples folder is created which contains sample application source code demonstrating the use of the Compressonator SDK.  These samples use the header files from the include folder and require linking with the prebuilt sample Compressonator library provided in the lib folder. Users can also build the Compressonator library using the source code from GPUOpen.
    Each of these installs will not remove prior v3.0 or older installations. The user should uninstall manually using the control panel “add remove programs".

-  **Texture Compression**

        **BC6H:** The quality of images varies slightly when processed with a CPU based encoder and decompressed by GPU compared to decompression by CPU, especially when generating MIP map levels with progressively lower resolution images. Our latest release compensates for these differences to reduce the errors that causes blocking artifacts and luminance changes.

        `ETC2_RGBA <gui_tool/user_guide/TextureCompression.html#etc2>`__ and `ETC2_RGBA1 <gui_tool/user_guide/TextureCompression.html#etc2>`__  is added to Compressonator SDK, that controls the degree of transparency of images for ETC2 blocks.

-  **CLI Options** 

        `Process Source and Destination Folders: <command_line_tool/commandline.html#test-analysis-logging-features-and-file-filters>`__

        The new CLI adds support for processing image files from a folder, without the need to specify a file name. Using a file filter, specific files types can also be selected for compression as needed.

        `CLI Analysis Log File: <command_line_tool/commandline.html#test-analysis-logging-features-and-file-filters>`__
        
        
        CLI will generate an output "process_results.txt" when -log is added to the compression command line options, users can change the default log file using the command -logfile, the log captures details of the source and destination files along with statistical data on performance and quality.


-  **3D Model**        
        
        **Model Mesh Compression:** Additional support for gltf 2.0 compression extensions (KHR_draco_mesh_compression) is added to `CLI <command_line_tool/commandline.html#mesh-compression>`__ and `GUI <gui_tool/user_guide/3DModelCompression.html#d-mesh-optimization-and-or-mesh-compression>`__ 

        **Selectable 3D Model Viewers:** Support for the Vulkan Viewer code introduced in 3.0 can now be set in GUI application settings, this is an alpha version and not expected  to work for all glTF models, feature for this viewer compared to DX12 has been limited.

        **3D Model Image Diff Viewer, Auto and Manual View:** This feature allows the user to select a manual override of the automated difference view of two rendered models. The Auto View switches render frames at a predetermined rate after two render cycles of each model view, the Manual View allows the users to manually switch view using the keyboards space bar.

-  **Image Viewer**.

        **Save View as:** Users can capture viewed images to file using context menu “Save View as” to either DDS, BMP or EXR files

        **Save Block as:** Users can now save any block to file using "Save Source Block … as" where … is the current cursor location translated to a block position.

        **Copy to Windows Clipboard:** Users can capture images to Windows Clipboard, using keyboard keys Ctrl C (captures displayed image), Alt C (captures original source image).

**Known issues and limitations** 

        - After uninstalling the SDK or CLI, Windows short cuts for the tools folder references are not removed. When selecting them in the start menu Windows will prompt for removal.
        - Vulkan Model Viewer, the code is a preview alpha version, it may cause GUI instability with various models!



V3.0 
~~~~

Mesh Processing”) if you wish to have a quick start on V3.0.

**Features**

`3D Mesh Optimization <#_Optimizing_Mesh>`__

-  Optimize mesh (.obj model and .bin file from .glTF model) using
   vertex cache optimization, overdraw reduction and mesh simplification
   using level of details.

-  `Analyzing Mesh <gui_tool/user_guide/UserGuide.html#Analyzing_Mesh>`__ : Provide ACMR (Average Cache
   Miss Ratio) and ATVR (Average Transformed Vertices Ratio) statistic
   from mesh optimization to analyze mesh optimization only.

`3D Mesh Compression <gui_tool/user_guide/UserGuide.html#Optimizing_Mesh>`__

-  Compress mesh (support only .obj model) using Draco library.

    `Image View switch between Original and
    Processed <#_Image_View_switch>`__

-  Original Image View and Processed Image View (Compressed Image View
   or Pixels Difference Image View) can be switched with simple key
   stokes (O or P)

**Known issues and limitations** 

-  “Mesh optimization only support glTF and obj file format while mesh
   compression only support obj file format.

-  Embedded gltf is not supported for now. Only gltf with external .bin
   mesh file is supported.

-  .obj file texture load (with an external mtl file) and view is not
   supported.

-  “AutoOpt” in the mesh optimization setting may not produce the best
   result, it is just a default setting which includes vertex cache
   optimization with cache size of 16, overdraw optimization with ACMR
   threshold 1.05 and vertex fetch optimization. The mesh optimization
   setting is model-dependent and depend on actual hardware. If result
   is not optimized, users are advised to use “UserOpt” setting and
   refer to `Mesh Optimizer Settings for “UserOpt”
   selection <gui_tool/user_guide/UserGuide.html#Mesh_Optimizer_Settings>`__ to set each value manually
   or check/uncheck certain optimization.

-  Mesh Optimization with all selected Mesh Optimizer Settings will need
   to work with `mesh analyzing <gui_tool/user_guide/UserGuide.html#Analyzing_Mesh>`__ with the values
   set to match the hardware to get the optimum result.

-  KTX 3 color channels multiple mip level may result in GUI crash and
   will be fix in next release.
