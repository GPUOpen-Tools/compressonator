/// AGS Library Overview
/// --------------------
/// This document provides an overview of the AGS (AMD GPU Services) library. The AGS library provides software developers with the ability to query 
/// AMD GPU software and hardware state information that is not normally available through standard operating systems or graphic APIs.
///
/// The latest version of the API is publicly hosted here: https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/AGS_SDK/.
/// It is also worth checking http://gpuopen.com/gaming-product/amd-gpu-services-ags-library/ for any updates and articles on AGS.

/// What's new in AGS 5.0 since version 4.x
/// ---------------------------------------
/// Version 5.0 is a major overhaul of the library designed to provide a much clearer view of the GPUs in the system and the displays attached to them. 
/// It also exposes the ability to query each display for HDR capabilities and put those HDR capable displays into various HDR modes.
/// Some functions such as agsGetGPUMemorySize and agsGetEyefinityConfigInfo have been removed in favor of including this information in the device & display enumeration.
/// Features include:
/// * Full GPU enumeration with adapter string, device id, revision id and vendor id.
/// * Per GPU display enumeration including information on display name, resolution and HDR capabilities.
/// * Optional user supplied memory allocator.
/// * Function to set displays into HDR mode.
/// * DirectX11 shader compiler controls.
/// * DirectX11 multiview extension.
/// * DirectX11 Crossfire API now supports using the API without needing a driver profile. Can also specify the transfer engine.
///
/// Using the AGS library
/// ---------------------
/// It is recommended to take a look at the source code for the samples that come with the AGS SDK:
/// * AGSSample
/// * CrossfireSample
/// * EyefinitySample
/// The AGSSample application is the simplest of the three examples and demonstrates the code required to initialize AGS and use it to query the GPU and Eyefinity state. 
/// The CrossfireSample application demonstrates the use of the new API to transfer resources on GPUs in Crossfire mode. Lastly, the EyefinitySample application provides a more 
/// extensive example of Eyefinity setup than the basic example provided in AGSSample.
/// There are other samples on Github that demonstrate the DirectX shader extensions, such as the Barycentrics11 and Barycentrics12 samples.
///
/// To add AGS support to an existing project, follow these steps:
/// * Link your project against the correct import library. Choose from either the 32 bit or 64 bit version.
/// * Copy the AGS dll into the same directory as your game executable.
/// * Include the amd_ags.h header file from your source code.
/// * Include the AGS hlsl files if you are using the shader intrinsics.
/// * Declare a pointer to an AGSContext and make this available for all subsequent calls to AGS.
/// * On game initialization, call agsInit() passing in the address of the context. On success, this function will return a valid context pointer.
/// * The agsInit() function should be called before the D3D device is created if the Crossfire mode is specified.
///
/// Don't forget to cleanup AGS by calling agsDeInit() when the app exits, after the device has been destroyed.
